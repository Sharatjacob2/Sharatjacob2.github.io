<em class="kf">I killed Jamie Nelson. They will never catch me. Neither will you.</em></p><p id="bfd8" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Jamie Nelson got out of bed.<br/>He walked over to the bathroom and started brushing his teeth. <br/>After rinsing his mouth, he took a good look at the mirror.<br/>A strong youthly face, with clear light brown eyes and cheeks that looked like they were chiseled by a sculptor, stared right back at him.</strong></p><p id="5771" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">Why won’t you catch me? Cause I am a genius. And well, nobody would believe an animal murdered a human.</em></p><p id="1bac" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">His focus was interrupted by Dave’s barking. <br/>Dave had run into the bathroom with the newspaper, wagging his tail furiously. Jamie leaned forward, took the paper from Dave’s mouth and patted his head.<br/>Dave began to happily lick Jamie’s foot.</strong></p><p id="70ad" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Jamie walked over to the kitchen. He broke a few eggs and poured the yolk neatly out onto the pan. Sally, lying on the counter, woke up startled at the sizzling noise, jumped off snarling and waving her furry tail in protest.</strong></p><p id="0147" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">Well, sure, tigers and lions have killed humans before but that’s more like you know, they were hungry. Me and my friends refer to the definition of murder as, how do you say it, “unlawful premeditated killing”. We are kinda sophisticated like that.</em></p><p id="9ea9" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Jamie sat down at his table and set the plate down. He didn’t pay attention to Sylvester swimming in the glass bowl. Sylvester kept bumping into the sides of the bowl.</strong></p><p id="8a90" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Behind him, he could hear Champ going at it on the wheel in his cage, running furiously as hamsters tend to do.</strong></p><p id="37d0" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">Although it’s different sounds, we all speak the same language. Just variations of it in each species. Humans don’t really know that, thankfully.</em></p><p id="8812" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Jamie read through the paper, scanning it until he came across exactly what he was looking for.</strong></p><p id="d4f7" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">His coverage of the Russian Mafia was splayed all over the entire fourth page.</strong></p><p id="97f1" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Annoyed, he read on.</strong>
<em class="kf">Why did we decide to kill him? </em><br/><strong class="jo kg">It was nearly midnight.<br/>Jamie walked over to the bedroom after feeding all the pets.</strong></p><p id="9e1f" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Jamie sat down at his desk getting ready to work on the next article.</strong></p><p id="5813" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">He stared at the blank screen waiting for the computer to come to life.</strong></p><p id="80ec" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">The whole thing sounds very morally grey to be honest. A nice editor with four pets. Feeds us regularly. Takes care of us. What a lovely person.</em></p><p id="9595" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">The phone rang.</strong></p><p id="d958" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">A warm and friendly voice was on the other side. “Hello? Is this Jamie? “</strong></p><p id="1fa3" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">“Yes.”</strong></p><p id="e430" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">“Hey, it’s Charlie. You liked your article? All published neat and tidy on the fourth page?”</strong></p><p id="41a5" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">“What article? I didn’t see my article anywhere.”</strong></p><p id="344e" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">“Huh? Whatcha mean? We took what you gave us and-”</strong></p><p id="7ced" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">“And minced it up into fine pieces is what you did!”, Jamie yelled into the phone.</strong></p><p id="20e3" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">He then took a deep breath. “Don’t you dare call that trash my article. You guys tried to play it safe. You are scared of them as much as everyone.”</strong></p><p id="69f8" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">“Look, Jamie, you don’t run the paper, we do.” The warmth and friendliness was gone. “This call was just a courtesy to inform you that we will not be publishing your second article. It’s too forward.”</strong></p><p id="a6ca" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">“IT’S TOO FORWARD?! NO, YOU ALL ARE TOO-”, Jamie went into a frenzy as he heard the phone click.</strong></p><p id="3646" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">He got up and kicked the chair out of the way.</strong></p><p id="9930" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">It’s always Dave that tries to help first. </em><br/><strong class="jo kg">Dave came running to Jamie only to get kicked in the stomach.</strong></p><p id="3d4f" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">“What do you want?!”, Jamie ran after Dave, who was frightened out of his mind. “ Always yipping and yapping like anything. Never a moment of peace!”</strong></p><p id="3fa6" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Dave ran to a corner and started scratching at the walls frantically. Jamie was staring at him like a wild animal.</strong></p><p id="052a" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">Sally knows to keep away but she doesn’t. She loves Dave. She saves him as always. One way or the other.</em></p><p id="9c6c" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Hearing a crash, Jamie turned around and saw Sally pushing bowls off the kitchen table.</strong></p><p id="acb4" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Enraged, Jamie didn’t notice as Dave slipped out of the corner and ran out. He, instead lunged forward for the cat, tripped and his jaw caught right on the table.</strong></p><p id="c50c" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Sylvester stared dumbly at him through the glass bowl.</strong></p><p id="f40c" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">Sometimes he gets angry at me. Broke my bowl twice. Nearly ran out of water to breathe.</em></p><p id="35ba" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Frustrated, Jamie got up and walked off to his room.</strong></p><p id="3a98" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">Another time, he nearly squeezed Champ so hard that he killed him. Restrained himself at the last moment. Probably to do it again later on.</em></p><p id="945d" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><strong class="jo kg">Jamie switched off the light and went to sleep</strong>.</p><p id="0854" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">Why do we want to kill him? <br/>Well, he’s a jerk. And it’s either us or him in the end.</em><strong class="jo kg">Jamie Nelson got out of bed.<br/>He walked over to the bathroom and started brushing his teeth. <br/>Entering the kitchen, he looked at his schedule on the fridge. <br/>Stopping by the newspaper office. <br/>Not gonna happen. <br/>Therapist appointment. <br/>If he felt like it, maybe.</strong></p><p id="33d6" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">I planned the whole thing. <br/>We rehearsed this a million times. Took a long time to set this up. But works smoothly like an oiled door. </em><br/><strong class="jo kg">Jamie prepared the coffee. <br/>As usual, Jamie set the cup down on the table. </strong><br/><em class="kf">The hamster will escape from his cage and topple it off just as Jamie is about to sit down at the table.<br/>Irritated, Jamie will get up to catch him and put him back in his cage.</em><br/><strong class="jo kg">Jamie got up from the table.</strong><br/><em class="kf">But the hamster will run like he never has before.<br/>The cat will start scraping at the door, diverting Jamie’s attention and buying the hamster enough time to reach the cup on the table. </em><br/><strong class="jo kg">Jamie walked to the door.</strong><br/><em class="kf">The dog will bring the arsenic to the hamster on the table. The hamster will pour it into his cup.<br/>The cat will stop scraping at the door.<br/>The hamster will run back to his cage causing Jamie to return back to his coffee.<br/>Then we will wait.</em><br/><strong class="jo kg">Jamie sat down at the table.<br/>Jamie will drink from his coffee.<br/>He took sips from his coffee while he read the paper. <br/>He could feel his vision blurring.<br/>Feeling dizzy, he grasped the sides of the table for support and his face came at eye level with Sylvester.</strong><br/><em class="kf">I will look into his eyes as the arsenic rips him apart.</em><br/><strong class="jo kg">Jamie attempted to stand up and noticed Sally and Dave were watching him intently. He growled, “I knew it, I always did-” and his feet began to give way.</strong><br/><em class="kf">The cat and the dog will trip him by jumping on his back and pouncing on his foot. We will watch him fall to the floor.</em><br/><strong class="jo kg">Jamie collapsed to the floor.</strong>“So brief me.”<br/>“Jamie Nelson, age 24, found dead by the neighbor when he came over to borrow some batteries.”<br/>“Cause of death?”<br/>“Arsenic poisoning.”<br/>“Well, any sign of a break-in, officer?”<br/>“No, Sir.” <br/>“Ok, why did they want me here?”<br/>“Sir, Jamie Nelson is one of the editors of The Daily Globe and also slightly an controversial yet influential figure. So they want to make sure there is no chance of foul play before revealing his death to the public.”<br/>“I see. Do you have anything else?”<br/>“We did find a letter. Not sure what to make of it.”<br/>“What do you mean?”<br/>“Sir, I think you will understand if you take a look at it yourself. Here.”</p><p id="a3c7" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">The inspector took out his glasses and inspected the neat cursive handwriting that started off with,<br/><em class="kf">“I killed Jamie Nelson. They will never catch me. Neither will you…”</em></p><p id="288f" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">After reading it through, the inspector took off his glasses and stared at the pets scattered all the room.<br/>The cat was sleeping on the counter.<br/>The dog was sleeping in a basket.<br/>The goldfish was mindlessly swimming around.<br/>The hamster was having a go at the wheel.</p><p id="af96" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">Seeing he was done reading, the officer added, “And we have checked with other samples of his writing around the room. They are-”</p><p id="6e6f" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">“Oh, no. Jamie.”</p><p id="84d5" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">Startled, the inspector and the officer turned around to see a middle-aged woman stumble into the house and before they could stop her, had run to Jamie’s body.</p><p id="e121" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">“Oh, Jamie! What have you done?! Oh my-”. The woman collapsed to the floor next to Jamie’s face. <br/>“Excuse me, maam, do you know this young man?”<br/>The woman looked up, tears slowly streaming down her face.<br/>“Yes, umm, I am uhh, his therapist.”</p><p id="fc26" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">“Oh! Maybe you could tell us the meaning of this letter, supposedly Jamie wrote.”<br/>The inspector extended the letter out to the woman.</p><p id="3878" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">Fumbling, she read through it slowly.<br/>When she was done, she sighed and nodded, “Yeah, Jamie definitely wrote this. His whole wild theory of the variations of animal language, all documented in my files at the house. He’s repeated it several times in several sessions. ”</p><p id="a575" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">Seeing the confused expression on the inspector’s face, she explained, “Jamie had a rather unfortunate incident at a wildlife park when he was a child. A rather nasty run-in with a jaguar they had. Being a tender age, it affected him mentally. He developed a certain aggression towards animals, because he began to believe they were always trying to kill him. His parents sent him to therapy when he began to get worse.”</p><p id="ee2b" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">“But he has all these pets around. Doesn’t seem like he hated them.”</p><p id="24bb" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">“Yeah, I advised him to get them one by one. Confronting your fears head on, you know. He was getting better at controlling himself. He had momentary breakdowns, though, if his job got stressful enough. And he would blame the pets for distracting him. Yell about them in my office but eventually calm down. He never hurt them, though.”</p><p id="b076" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">She paused to take a deep breath and control her composure.</p><p id="6c17" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">“Well, recently, there’s been this talk of an article at work that he really wanted to get them to publish. He had spent around half a year on it. Big stuff. I came over today to enquire if the other editors had let him publish it. I guess they didn’t. But I never thought he would break down so terribly. This horrific letter, poisoning himself, oh my..”<br/>She stared at Jamie’s body sprawled on the floor and her vision blurred again, hidden by a thin film of tears.</p><p id="8d54" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">The officer escorted her out of the house.<br/>The inspector watched as Jamie’s body was removed from the room and the evidence was packaged. Soon he was the only man left in the house.</p><p id="1b9e" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">An eerie silence filled the room.</p><p id="c623" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">He walked over to the dining table, leaned forward and stared intensely at the goldfish.<br/>Bobbing up and down, the goldfish’s gaze didn’t waver and kept up at eye contact with him.<br/>Under his breath, the inspector softly uttered, “Can’t believe I nearly thought you were a killer for a second.”</p><p id="8f13" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">And for a split second, he could nearly swear he had seen it wink.</p><p id="afc6" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">But his concentration was interrupted by the cat hissing and the dog barking simultaneously at the same time. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the hamster begin to rattle relentlessly at the door of the cage.</p><p id="0481" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">Taken aback by the sudden noise, he backed out of the house quickly.</p><p id="d072" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">Right as he stepped out the door, they stopped and the silence returned.</p><p id="e135" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">The inspector glanced at the letter in his hand. He had forgotten to hand it in as evidence. He read through the last paragraph once more.</p><p id="ff82" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">“I will look into his eyes as the arsenic rips him apart.The cat and the dog will trip him by jumping on his back and pouncing on his foot. We will watch him fall to the floor.</em></p><p id="8332" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw"><em class="kf">Why did I make Champ write the letter (amazing how capable hamsters are with their tiny fingers) ? Arrogance, I suppose. Taunting humans is fun. Besides, whoever reads this, they will definitely make up an explanation for how a human must have written it. So blind to the truth. Deep down, someone will wonder if I did it.”</em></p><p id="58a6" class="jm jn bi jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke gf cw">He crumpled the letter up and tossed it aside.</p></div></div></section></div></article>
